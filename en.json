    "HELP_TEXT": "Crimson Empire\u2019s cowardly sneak attack caught us by surprise. Now it\u2019s time to gather the troops and strike back!\\n\\nThis guide will help you get started on your way to becoming a celebrated army commander.\\n\\n1. Starting the Campaign: Missions\\nThe best way to win back our lands is to carry out the missions. Tap the icon on the bottom left of the screen to expand the missions.\\n\\n2. Energy\\nLightning is the symbol for Energy. Monitor your energy closely. Moving units, attacking the enemy and collecting supplies from resource plots consume one Energy point each. Your energy will be replenished every few minutes.\\n\\n3. Supplies\\nSupplies are your bread and butter in Army Attack!\\nSupplies are needed to repair both your units and defenses. The quantity of Supplies needed to repair a unit varies depending on the type of unit and how much health the unit has left.\\nSupplies are also a great source for earning Cash. The towns you have liberated need supplies. Part with some of your supplies, and they will give you cash. Just tap on the town and start the process.\\n\\n3.1 Getting Supplies\\nSupplies are delivered on Drop Zones. Just place a Drop Zone on your game area, and then tap the Drop Zone to select the type of drop you want. Remember that the drops containing more Supplies also cost more cash and have longer delivery times.\\n\\n3.2 Storage of your supplies\\nBear in mind that there is a cap on the quantity of Supplies you can store. To raise this level you have to build storage structures found in the Shop under the Supplies tab.\\n\\n4. Cash\\nYou'll need cash when you\u2019re looking to buy new buildings, units or other cool stuff from the Shop; and sometimes a lot of it!\\nGet cash by destroying enemy units and structures.\\nAnother good source of Cash is the liberated towns. Check out how to make the towns work for you in the Supplies part of this guide.\\n\\n5. Buildings\\nBuilding a powerful base with a wide variety of buildings is one of the key steps toward reconquering our lands.\\nThe buildings have two main purposes. First, buildings allow you to train units. This means that every time you build a new building, you\u2019ll get your hands on a new unit type. Second, each building raises the unit cap, meaning that the more buildings you have, the more units you can command.\\nTo complete the construction of a building, the player needs specific building items. You can sometimes find these items by destroying enemy units.\\n\\n6. Defenses\\nDefenses help you to control your area. Defensive structures fire on the enemy when it enters the structure\u2019s defensive parameter. Tap the defensive building to see the extent of the defensive parameter.\\nBe sure to repair the defensive buildings when they sustain damage. You can do this in the same way as you repair\/heal your units.\\n\\n7. Attacking\\nTo attack an enemy unit, you must first move to a location that is within striking distance from that enemy unit.\\nWhen attacking enemy units, it is important to take advantage of the multiple attack opportunity. To do this, you need to move two or more units to within striking distance from the enemy before attacking. This way, all of your units within striking distance will fire when you engage the enemy.",
